🚀 Just Built an Advanced Indo-Pak Terror Threat Intelligence Dashboard! 🔍

I’m excited to share my latest data analytics & visualization project—an interactive Terror Threat Intelligence Platform analyzing cross-border incidents between India and Pakistan (2010-2024).
🔍 Project Goals:

✅ Analyze patterns in terror incidents (geographic, temporal, group-wise)
✅ Visualize trends in casualties, attack types, and group activity
✅ Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic filtering and real-time insights
✅ Simulate predictive modeling (future scope) for threat forecasting
🛠️ Tech Stack Used:

🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy)
📊 Streamlit (Interactive web app)
📈 Plotly & Matplotlib (Advanced visualizations)
🌍 Geospatial Analysis (Maps, heatmaps)
🔄 Data Simulation (Synthetic but realistic dataset)
🎨 UI/UX (Custom CSS, animations, Lottie)
💡 Key Features:

✔ Dynamic Filters (Country, location, terrorist groups, attack types)
✔ Animated Visuals (Trend lines, heatmaps, bubble maps)
✔ Word Cloud (Text analysis of incident descriptions)
✔ Threat Intelligence Brief (Automated report generation)
✔ Mobile-responsive design

🔗 Check out the code & demo video in the comments!

This project strengthened my skills in data storytelling, dashboard design, and security analytics. Excited to explore more applications of data science in counter-terrorism and policy planning!
